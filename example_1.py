# Given a list of integers, find the maximum difference between any two elements.
# You must solve this problem in linear time and with constant space complexity.
from typing import List


def max_difference(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    # add implementation

# Example usage:
nums = [7, 3, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6]
result = max_difference(nums)
print(f"Maximum difference: {result}") # --> 8
